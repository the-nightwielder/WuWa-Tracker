# WuWa Tracker

An unofficial Android companion for **Wuthering Waves**. WuWa Tracker provides server-reset countdowns, daily and endgame checklists, banner schedules, and a source-linked intelligence feed for official announcements, community reports, and unconfirmed leaks.

This project was developed with substantial AI assistance using an informal “vibe coding” workflow. It is a fan project, not an official Kuro Games product, and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Kuro Games.

## Features

- **Per-Server Reset & Reminders:** Daily reset countdowns for America, Europe, Asia, SEA, and HMT servers, displayed in the device’s local time. Optional reset and custom reminders.
- **Live Server-Synced Banner Schedules:** Active and upcoming banner cards display exact start and end dates/times synced directly with live Prydwen and Game8 server countdowns across all regional servers (**America**, **Europe**, **Asia**, **HMT**, and **SEA**).
- **Dynamic Server Switching & Local Time Conversion:** Switching the server in the app instantly updates the banner schedule to match that server's regional schedule, converted side-by-side with your device's auto-detected local timezone (e.g. `IST`, `EDT`, `PST`, `BST`, `SGT`).
- **5-Star Showcase & Color-Coded Badges:** Resonator banners highlight 5-star debut and rerun resonators (filtering out 4-star rate-ups) and pair them with signature weapons using color-coded badges (`[ 5★ DEBUT ]`, `[ 5★ RERUN ]`, `[ 5★ SIGNATURE ]`, `[ 5★ FEATURED ]`).
- **Uncongested Card Design:** Consolidated timeline headers at the top of expanded cards keep individual character and weapon rows smooth, spacious, and easy to scan.
- **Checklists & Endgame Tracking:** Daily and Lunite checklists, plus monthly Endgame checklist reminders for Tower of Adversity, Whimpering Wastes, and Endstate Matrix.
- **Intelligence Feed:** Categorized feed separating official confirmations, community reports, and unconfirmed leaks with source links and evidence labels.

The monthly Endgame checkboxes reset at the start of each calendar month in the selected game server’s time zone. They are convenience reminders; they do not track the individual modes’ live rotation start and end dates. The Endgame tab can display source-derived dates when the feed provides them, but its built-in recurring entries do not have exact dates. Use the in-game timers for current rotation timing.

## Intelligence feed and updates

The feed is assembled by a Python pipeline and published as `feed.json` through GitHub Pages. A GitHub Actions workflow runs once per day, automatically triggers on repository pushes, and can also be started manually from the repository’s **Actions** tab. The app’s **Refresh intelligence** button downloads the latest feed already published to GitHub Pages.

The feed is best-effort. Sources can change, become unavailable, or omit information; automated extraction and summaries can be incomplete or wrong. A report’s presence does not confirm that it is true. Treat leaks as unconfirmed, and use Kuro Games announcements and the in-game schedule as the final authority.

## Sources and attribution

WuWa Tracker links to public sources and uses them as references for schedule and feed information. Source availability and coverage may change.

### Images and game intellectual property

Resonator and weapon image URLs are sourced from the [Wuthering Waves Wiki on Fandom](https://wutheringwaves.fandom.com/) when a matching image is available. The feed carries image URLs rather than the image files; the app fetches thumbnails from Fandom at runtime and caches them on the device for the relevant banner period.

The app also includes visual resources in its Android project, including tab backgrounds and launcher artwork. Some may depict Wuthering Waves characters or other game-related material. Wuthering Waves, its characters, logos, and original game artwork belong to their respective rights holders, including Kuro Games. The project’s code terms below do not license that material. Rights holders can contact the maintainer through the [repository issue tracker](https://github.com/the-nightwielder/WuWa-Tracker/issues) to raise a concern.

## Security, privacy, and use at your own risk

This project is AI-assisted and has not been represented as professionally audited or guaranteed secure. Use it only if you accept the risks of running third-party software and relying on automatically collected public information. Review the source code and permissions before installing or building it. Do not use leaked information as authoritative guidance for purchases or gameplay decisions.

The app requests internet access to retrieve the public feed and image thumbnails. It also requests notification and boot-completed permissions to deliver reminders. The project does not intentionally include feed-service credentials in the Android app.

The software and feed are provided “as is,” without warranties of any kind. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the maintainer disclaims liability for loss, damage, security issues, inaccurate data, service outages, or other consequences arising from use of the app or feed. You are responsible for deciding whether and how to use them. This notice does not remove rights or liabilities that cannot legally be excluded in your jurisdiction.
